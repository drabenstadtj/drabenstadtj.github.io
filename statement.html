        <p>
            In crafting my project, I found the perfect medium to be a web page of a timeline. Using a web page allows
            for a wide reach across the internet, a place where many online gamers (the project's expected audience)
            have access to. By incorporating videos, images, and interactive elements, I presented events in the history
            of Counter-Strike in a visually appealing and interactive manner. Counter-Strike has been a significant part
            of my life for the past decade, and I've spent thousands of hours immersed in its world and have always been
            interested in the unique relationship the developers and community had. When this project opportunity arose,
            I immediately knew I wanted to explore Counter-Strike and its unique developer-fan relations.
            <br><br>
            My process began by reflecting on what I wanted to convey about Counter-Strike. I jotted down events that I
            remembered, pivotal moments that resonated with me and related to the development of the game. Then, I
            conducted further research to fill in the gaps and provide a comprehensive overview. I chose to use a
            timeline as the game has a long varied history of more than 20 years, so weaving together my personal
            experiences backed with historical facts to create a narrative that captures the essence of Counter-Strike's
            evolution.
            <br><br>
            Through this project, I hope to shed light on the importance of communication between developers and players
            in the gaming community. Counter-Strike exemplifies how fostering a strong community and maintaining an open
            dialogue can greatly enhance a game and bring players together. Additionally, I aim to highlight the impact
            of esports on game development. By showcasing Counter-Strike's journey from a beloved game to a prominent
            esport, I hope to illustrate how competitive gaming drives innovation and shapes the future of the industry,
            but also brings intense scrutiny to the developers decisions. I found these topics to be a great instance of
            the intersectionality of social and industrial aspects of game development.
            <br><br>
            My project chronicles the legacy of Counter-Strike and brings attention to the transformative power of
            community-driven development. My hope is that by exploring the game's history and its relationship with its
            community, viewers will gain a deeper appreciation for the profound influence developer-fan relations can
            have on a game and its community. I strive to spark conversations and inspire others to embrace the
            collaborative spirit that defines this gaming community.
