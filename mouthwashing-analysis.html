      <a href="index.html">Home</a> > Complicity and Collapse in <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>
    </h1>

    <p>
      <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> is a narrative-driven indie game that follows a group of
      crewmembers stranded aboard a failing spaceship. As the story unfolds, the
      player witnesses the characters unraveling through addiction,
      manipulation, guilt, and the collapse of moral responsibility. Rather than
      offering clear choices or paths to redemption, the game fragments the
      narrative across timelines and character perspectives. The result is a
      disorienting, emotionally heavy experience that asks the player not to fix
      anything but endure it (<i>MOUTHWASHING</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The game deliberately subverts player agency and narrative clarity to
      immerse players in feelings of helplessness and moral paralysis. Through
      spatial storytelling, fractured chronology, and environmental cues, the
      game turns interactivity into a source of discomfort rather than
      empowerment. Drawing on the theories of Janet Murray, Espen Aarseth, Henry
      Jenkins, and Abbe Don as a lens to interpret <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> shows the unique
      properties of digital media to tell a story not about taking action, but
      about surviving the consequences of actions already taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening sequence of <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> places the player in a small pilot
      room aboard the ship. The non-diegetic interface is sparse, offering
      little more than basic prompts and minimal feedback. A warning alert
      appears: the ship is on a collision course with an asteroid. The player is
      prompted to make a manual course correction and given a single
      option—steer right. After executing the maneuver, the system sounds an
      urgent warning: the current heading leads directly into the asteroid, but
      the autopilot is programmed to steer away. The player is then given the
      option to override this correction. Doing so requires locating a key,
      inserting it into a control panel, and confirming the override. There is
      no option to cancel and the only path forward is to take manual control
      and commit to the fatal course. Once activated, the room floods with red
      light, alarms blare, and the monitors flash with system failures. It is
      the game’s first interactive moment—and the outcome is already
      irreversible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sequence immediately subverts traditional expectations of agency in
      video games. As Janet Murray explains in Hamlet on the Holodeck, digital
      narratives often promise new forms of engagement, inviting players to
      explore “narrative pleasures intrinsic to cyberspace itself” (Murray, 68).
      <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>, however, deliberately denies these pleasures. The crash is
      inevitable, and the only options the player is permitted to take are the
      one that causes it or no action at all. The game invites the player into a
      moment that appears interactive, even urgent, only to reveal that the
      outcome was predetermined. What seems like a choice becomes an act of
      complicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This denial of agency is a deliberate thematic choice. The opening mirrors
      the emotional arc of the game’s characters, particularly Jimmy, who
      initiates the crash. Later revelations lead the player to discover that
      Jimmy assaulted Anya, another crewmember, leading to her pregnancy. Rather
      than face the consequences of his actions, he sabotages the ship in a
      desperate attempt to erase the future. Replaying the crash in this context
      reframes the player’s participation: as a player you aren’t just guiding a
      ship, or even avoiding a collision—you are acting as Jimmy burying his
      guilt. By aligning the player’s input with Jimmy’s selfish decision, the
      game begins its central project of entangling the player in cycles of
      moral failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The environmental design reinforces this emotional tone. As Henry Jenkins
      argues in his theory of narrative architecture, game spaces do more than
      provide a space to tell stories—they shape how stories are understood,
      felt, and enacted (Jenkins 4). Here, the sterile isolation of the pilot
      room, the flickering lights, the absence of any voice or feedback from the
      crew, all work to create a sense of confinement and foreboding. The pilot
      room becomes a sealed chamber of bad decisions—a pattern the rest of the
      game will repeat. This sequence establishes <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>’s central tone:
      inevitability. There is no heroic save, no branching choice that could
      have altered what happened. You perform a disaster you didn’t choose, and
      in doing so, the game asks you not to take control, but to share in the
      weight of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>’s most disorienting sequences, the player, as
      Jimmy, begins in a room where Swansea is tied to a chair. A gun sits on
      the table in front of him. The game doesn’t offer alternatives; the player
      must pick up the gun and shoot. But instead of killing Swansea
      immediately, the action transports the player into a tight and suffocating
      cemetery. The space is dense and enclosed, with gravestones and mausoleums
      crowding the cemetery. At the center is a mausoleum bearing a portrait of
      Daisuke–a former crewmate who died earlier in the story after Jimmy
      manipulated him into entering the ship’s vents, leading to his death.
      Swansea runs around the area, lashing out if he gets too close. The player
      must shoot him three times. After the final shot, the game cuts to a
      stylized scene: Silhouettes of Jimmy and Swansea appear in front of a
      projected screen, with Swansea still tied to the chair. He delivers a
      monologue before the scene cuts again, now showing his body slumped
      forward, dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sequence complicates the idea of player agency. Janet Murray
      describes digital environments as offering participatory storytelling,
      where players can shape outcomes (Murray 74). Here, the player performs a
      violent act, but the result is fragmented and symbolic. Shooting Swansea
      doesn’t lead to a direct consequence. Instead, the game pulls the player
      into an abstract space where the meaning of the action is delayed,
      obscured, and expanded upon. The sense of control is minimal. The player
      is asked to follow through with the scene, but not given any real
      influence over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The setting plays a central narrative role. Henry Jenkins argues that game
      spaces often carry their own storytelling weight by drawing on players’
      existing associations and embedding narrative meaning into the environment
      (Jenkins 6).The cemetery is emotionally loaded: Daisuke’s mausoleum
      recalls Jimmy’s earlier actions of manipulating him into taking actions
      that result in his death, and the environment is built to feel closed-off
      and suffocating. It doesn’t need exposition to tell the player that this
      is a space shaped by grief and consequence. The narrow paths and visual
      density make the sequence feel like a confrontation with repressed memory
      rather than with Swansea himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swansea’s monologue further shifts the focus from action to reflection.
      His words don’t explain the plot or resolve tension. Instead, he speaks
      about disillusionment, honesty, and the crushing realization that
      redemption doesn't always feel like salvation. It's about a man who tried
      to change, and did change, but found no peace in it. He ends not as a hero
      or villain, but as someone who finally knows himself and dares to say it
      out loud, and points out Jimmy’s inability to do the same. Abbe Don’s idea
      of contextual storytelling is relevant here, where meaning emerges through
      interaction with a system or story over time (Don 387). Swansea’s tone and
      meaning are only fully understood if the player has followed the game’s
      emotional arc. His reflection builds on everything the player has already
      witnessed—Daisuke’s death, Anya’s withdrawal and suicide, Jimmy’s
      breakdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final image of Swansea, dead, bloodied, and slumped in his chair,
      doesn’t resolve anything. The sequence offers no branching outcome, no
      emotional payoff, and no escape from what came before. It leaves the
      player in a familiar position within <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>: watching something
      irreversible, having participated in it, but unable to change it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the final scenes of <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>, the player takes control of
      Curly, who is confined inside a cryopod. From behind fogged glass, Curly
      watches as Jimmy enters the room, tells him, "[he]... fixed it," and then
      walks out of view. A gunshot follows, accompanied by a flash of light. The
      player cannot move. There are no branching options, no way to intervene or
      respond. Interaction is limited to small actions, like adjusting the
      camera slightly. The scene plays out slowly, carrying a sense of quiet
      inevitability. This moment speaks directly to Janet Murray’s concept of
      immersion and agency (Murray 74). While Murray argues that digital media
      often promises participatory storytelling—offering players the chance to
      enact meaningful change—<i>MOUTHWASHING</i> strips that away entirely. The game
      uses that denial thematically. You are immersed in the world, but unable
      to act upon it. As a player, you interact with the game's systems but
      these actions only advanced a predetermined future. You are not empowered
      to change the outcome but instead made complicit in it. The game invites
      your participation while denying you agency, implicating you in Jimmy’s
      spiral through your performance. The interface becomes a kind of
      anti-agency, aligning the player’s helplessness with Curly’s own moral
      paralysis. You don’t just watch Jimmy die—you endure the knowledge that
      you could do nothing to stop it. The tragedy isn’t that he dies but that
      he dies believing he made things right. He never acknowledges his
      wrongdoings or faces consequences for his actions. As a player, you’re
      left with the unsettling weight of his self-deception and your role in
      sustaining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scene also exemplifies Henry Jenkins’ idea of narrative architecture,
      where game environments are not just backdrops, but storytelling devices
      (Jenkins 4). The cryopod, once a space associated with safety or stasis,
      becomes a tomb—both literal and emotional. Curly is entombed with his
      memories, and the player is sealed in with the consequences of everything
      that has unfolded. This transformation is solidified by the game’s final
      image: you alone in the pod. It is not a place of rest or redemption, but
      a vessel of guilt, failure, and experiences that cannot be undone. The
      confined visual perspective reinforces this: you view the world through
      layers of distortion, from behind glass, immobilized. The spatial design
      here doesn't support exploration, it communicates emotional suffocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emotional impact of this moment, however, depends entirely on the
      interpretation of the game, making it a clear example of Abbe Don’s
      contextual storytelling (Don 384). The meaning of Jimmy’s suicide is not
      given—it is constructed through everything the player has experienced
      leading up to this point. As the player, you have witnessed his
      manipulation, his unraveling, and the damage he’s inflicted on others and
      himself. In that sense, the scene doesn’t deliver narrative closure; it
      delivers emotional accumulation. As the developers noted in a Washington
      Post interview, the phrase “I hope this hurts” appears multiple times
      throughout the game (Park). And by the time you reach this point, it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sequence functions as a kind of ending, but without catharsis. There
      is no resolution, no redemption, just memory and the unshakable feeling
      that you were made to witness something you didn’t want to see. The
      player’s lack of control is the emotional heart of the scene. In the end,
      <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> doesn’t ask you to act, but asks you to live with what cannot
      be undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where literature or film might depict guilt, helplessness, or moral
      failure from a distance, <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> places the player directly inside
      those feelings. It does not simply show these emotions, but it forces the
      player perform them. The game’s interactivity does not grant agency or
      choice; it creates entanglement. The player is implicated in actions they
      cannot prevent and outcomes they cannot change. This design aligns with
      Janet Murray’s and Espen Aarseth’s theories, though it applies them in
      unconventional ways. Murray discusses how digital environments allow for
      participatory storytelling and immersive engagement (Murray 74). Aarseth
      focuses on the nontrivial effort required to navigate ergodic texts and
      the emotional resonance of paths not taken (Aarseth, 1, 4). <i>MOUTHWASHING</i>
      builds on both ideas, but turns them toward discomfort rather than
      empowerment. The game uses interactivity to restrict the player’s control
      and foreground their emotional proximity to failure. In doing so, it
      demonstrates how digital media can convey meaning, but rather than through
      freedom, it does so through limitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to other narrative forms, the experience <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> offers is
      uniquely visceral. The player's complicity—pressing the button, pulling
      the trigger, watching helplessly—is essential to the game’s emotional
      power. It is not the choices the player makes that define the story, but
      the weight of knowing they could never have chosen differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> turns traditional video game storytelling on its head. It
      withholds agency, fragments truth, and redefines interactivity as a source
      of emotional weight rather than narrative control. The player is not a
      protagonist shaping events, but a witness bound to the consequences of
      others’ decisions. Each scene from piloting the ship into failure, pulling
      the trigger in a symbolic graveyard, to watching helplessly from behind
      glass reinforces the game’s commitment to discomfort and narrative
      paralysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the frameworks of Janet Murray, Espen Aarseth, Henry Jenkins, and
      Abbe Don, <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> reveals the unique capabilities of digital media to
      explore themes of guilt, powerlessness, and memory. Murray’s immersive
      environments become spaces of paralysis. Aarseth’s unread paths become
      emotional burdens. Jenkins’ storytelling spaces become haunted
      architecture. Don’s contextual storytelling becomes a means of layering
      meaning through perspective, silence, and spatial design.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, <i>MOUTHWASHING</i> offers the illusion of control, but undermines it
      at every turn. Its power lies in how it entangles the player in its events
      and forces them to endure it. It offers a vision of interactive
      storytelling that is more than a fantasy of choice; rather an experience
      of shared suffering.
