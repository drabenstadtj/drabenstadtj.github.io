      <h1>Discards</h1>

      <p>
        Discards is a first-person narrative game built in Godot that explores
        themes of identity, digital consciousness, and moral responsibility. The
        player enters a liminal city and is given the ability to clone their
        consciousness into a "discard" — a duplicate that will exist
        independently. The central choice asks whether the player is willing to
        endure pain themselves or create a clone who will bear it instead. The
        outcome is deliberately ambiguous, leaving the player to sit with the
        consequences of their decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        I made Discards for my Narrative and Technology class, where we studied
        the theoretical foundations of interactive storytelling. Key readings
        included Janet Murray's work on the properties of digital environments,
        Henry Jenkins' theories of environmental and embedded narrative, and
        Espen Aarseth's framework for ergodic literature and cybertext.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Principles</h3>

        <img
          src="../static/images/discards-smoking.png"
          alt="Discards - smoking scene"
          class="img-strip"
        />
        <figcaption>Liminal city environment from Discards</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Discards is structured around Janet Murray's four properties of digital
        environments: procedural, participatory, spatial, and encyclopedic. The
        procedural property is realized through programmed rules that simulate
        the consequences of the player's choices — the systems enforce outcomes
        rather than simply narrating them. The participatory property is
        expressed through meaningful choice; the player's decisions are not
        cosmetic but reshape the trajectory of the experience. The spatial
        property drives the storytelling through movement and exploration, with
        the liminal city serving as both setting and narrative mechanism,
        guiding the player through space to encounter the story.
      </p>

      <h3>Narrative and Storytelling</h3>

      <figure class="demo-figure">
        <img
          src="../static/images/discards-bar.png"
          alt="Discards - bar scene"
          class="img-strip"
        />
        <figcaption>A diner scene from Discards</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The narrative design draws on Henry Jenkins' concepts of embedded and
        evocative storytelling. Clues and context are distributed throughout the
        environment, rewarding attentive exploration rather than delivering
        exposition through dialogue or cutscenes. The game is influenced by
        Mouthwashing and Arctic Eggs, both of which use environmental detail and
        tonal ambiguity to build narrative meaning. Espen Aarseth's concepts of
        ergodic structure and aporia are central to the game's design — the
        player has one chance to create the clone, and once that decision is
        made, the outcome is locked in. There is no reversal, no second attempt,
        only the weight of the choice.
      </p>

      <h3>Influences</h3>

      <p>
        The primary influence for Discards is SOMA (Frictional Games, 2015),
        which interrogates what it means to transfer consciousness and whether a
        copy is the same as the original. Where SOMA presents these transfers as
        events that happen to the player, Discards gives the player direct
        agency over whether to create a version of themselves that will suffer.
        The distinction shifts the moral weight from observation to
        participation.
