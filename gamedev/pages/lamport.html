        <p>
          Lamport General Systems is a first-person immersive sim where you play
          as a lone technician trapped in a derelict data center, manipulating
          hostile Byzantine fault-tolerant networks through message
          interception, code injection, and physical sabotage. As you navigate
          five interconnected subnetworks—each controlling a different aspect of
          an authoritarian surveillance state—you must decide whether to repair
          or destroy each system, with your choices rippling through the
          facility's adaptive networks and determining the fate of a nationwide
          deployment of automated control infrastructure.

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="page-section-content">
        <h3>Conceptual Development</h3>
        <p>
          The initial challenge was discovering the core idea itself. This took
          several weeks of exploring different interests—starting with a class
          assignment about story-generative games, then diving into immersive sims
          and the film Alien— before landing on Byzantine fault tolerance as the
          central mechanic that could unite these influences.
        </p>

        <h3>Adapting BFT Systems for Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Byzantine fault-tolerant systems are designed for reliability and
          efficiency, not entertainment. A major ongoing challenge is designing an
          entirely custom BFT protocol that maintains conceptual authenticity
          while being fun, challenging, and interactive. This required
          understanding the core principles deeply enough to know what could be
          modified without losing what makes BFT systems interesting.
        </p>

        <h3>Balancing Systemic Depth with Player Comprehension</h3>
        <p>
          Making Byzantine consensus, terminal interfaces, and command-line
          interaction understandable and engaging without overwhelming players or
          reducing them to trivial mechanics was a constant balancing act. The
          systems needed to be complex enough to create emergent gameplay while
          accessible enough that players could build mental models and make
          informed decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>Communicating a Complex Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Pitching and documenting a game about Byzantine fault tolerance to
          audiences unfamiliar with distributed systems required finding the right
          language and framing. Technical accuracy needed to coexist with clear
          player experience goals and accessible explanations.
        </p>

        <h3>Letting World-Building Emerge from Context</h3>
        <p>
          Rather than making arbitrary creative decisions, the challenge was
          learning to let gameplay mechanics, thematic goals, and narrative
          context guide world-building choices. Each design decision needed to
          serve both the systemic gameplay and the themes of corporate negligence
          and authoritarian control.

        This project began in Fall 2025, during which the design documents
        outlined below and a digital prototype were created. Future work
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Playtest and refine the gameplay loop based on feedback</li>
        <li>
          Build environmental storytelling systems (terminal logs, worker
          artifacts, facility degradation)
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement how player choices in one subnetwork affect and cascade
          through other areas
        </li>
        <li>Implement humanoid robot AI and detection mechanics</li>
        <li>Create sound design and adaptive music systems</li>
        <li>
          Resolve open design questions around backdoor system mechanics and
          remaining subnetwork spaces
        </li>
