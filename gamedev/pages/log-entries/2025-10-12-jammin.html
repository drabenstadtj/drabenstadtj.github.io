          This weekend I participated in my second Pitt Games 4 Social Impact
          game jam. Last year, I participated in a group for the game jam and
          let's just say it didn't go very well. Our ideas last year lacked
          focus, we failed to prioritize, and we didn't delegate well. On top of
          all of that, most of us had never even touched much of the software we
          needed to use to create the game we planned to make. Needless to say, it was a disaster
          that led to one of our group members—my partner Paige—staying up for
          almost all night to recreate our original idea in Twine. We ended up
          winning the First Penguin Award for aiming high and failing
          spectacularly.
        </p>

          Anyway, enough about last year. I've gained a considerable amount of
          experience and knowledge in nearly every aspect of game design and
          development since last year, having made several games for classes and
          also studied interactive narratives. I came into this year with a plan
          and a number of procedures and an outline of how things should go. I
          wanted to ensure that we set tight player experience goals, as I felt
          that would help us keep our scope reasonable and lead to our game
          being focused and getting our theme across well. This ended up working
          well. Following the creation of some concise player experience goals,
          we began brainstorming. I am once again reminded of how difficult it
          is to come up with good ideas in a short period of time and when
          you're actually <em>trying</em> to generate them. As a result of this,
          I felt that our game's gameplay didn't exactly innovate. I was worried
          about this at first because I felt that only a novel idea would make
          the game worth making. I learned that this is wrong.

        <p>
          We ended up going for a 2.5D platformer where you play as a penguin
          fleeing its home on an iceberg. Throughout your journey, you encounter
          other birds who—unlike you—can fly, and thus have it much easier to
          migrate. You encounter hardship via puzzles including sharks,
          collapsing platforms, and ramps which you must gain speed on to reach
          areas. Keeping our scope tight ended up really paying off, and most of
          our first full day was spent making solid bones (dialogue system,
          movement system, and levels). Following this, we connected them up
          during the night and spent time polishing on our last day.
        </p>

        <p>
          I made the dialogue system first, which is something I find incredibly
          rewarding. Finding ways to impart even more life and character into
          simple text on the screen is something I could spend near infinite
          amounts of time on, yet I find myself making Animal Crossing-esque
          systems every time... I also ended up making assets for our main
          level, including some boulders and icebergs (incredibly challenging...
          I know), and doing miscellaneous programming tasks. This is a
          relatively art-focused role compared to what I usually find myself
          doing, which I enjoyed. On top of everything, I was our resident Git
          expert, tasked with fixing all merge conflicts and keeping things
          straight.

          Our game came together with relatively few hiccups, with the exception
          of a number of systems breaking due to our project structure's
          disorganization near the end of the jam—which we fixed. After all of
          our hard work, we won an award for technical achievement! This was an
          incredible experience that was enhanced by bringing some formal
          structure to it, and with the addition of learning to work with new
          faces, was a weekend I'm not going to forget. And now.... I present
          our game:
