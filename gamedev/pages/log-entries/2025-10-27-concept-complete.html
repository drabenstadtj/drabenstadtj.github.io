          After nine weeks of research and development, I finally have a complete concept document for my game Lamport General Systems. The process started with working through early chapters of Game Design Workshop 5th Edition to learn formal design concepts. I spent a lot of time following my interests wherever they led be it watching videos about Alien's creation and how its tension was built, connecting it back to my past research in distributed systems, or playing tons of games to see what resonated. After much of this occurred, the core idea emerged: what if Byzantine fault-tolerant networks were the enemy?

The concept doc lays out everything, however I know much of it may change once implementation begins. That said, having it written down feels really good. It's a reference point for when I inevitably get stuck in implementation details or start doubting design decisions. After weeks of scattered research and half-formed ideas bouncing around in my head, it's satisfying to finally have a coherent vision.
