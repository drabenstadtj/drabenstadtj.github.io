          During my meeting last week I found out that there is a Capstone Pitch
          Event happening for the DNID program for which I have the option of
          presenting my game concept <i>Lamport General Systems</i>. I think
          it's a great opportunity to get some feedback from people other than
          my Independent Study Professor Dr. Eldin. It just so happens to occur
          on the most busy week of my semester thus far... Anyway, the bulk of
          work I did this week was related to my pitch. I started by finding all
          the informative work about making game pitches I could. A lot of this
          work was more geared toward pitching to investors and publishers which
          does not apply to this particular event. So, rather than focus on
          selling my game I just tried to convey what it's all about. My
          assumption was that I would simply transpose some information from my
          concept document which I honed in last week, rewording and structuring
          to get my game across concisely, and adding some graphics. However,
          the creation of my pitch caused me to reckon with a number of
          questions which I hadn't considered yet. Part of today I spent hashing
          out the <i>core loop</i>, which wasn't something that I had concretely
          figured out yet. On top of that, being forced to distill my ideas into
          the simplest wording possible made me make decisions about things I
          only had vague ideas about. I'm rather nervous about presenting my
          pitch tomorrow but I'm passionate about this project and I have some
          feedback to glean from it. I'm noticing that concept docs, pitches,
          and treatments are for more than having your concepts written down,
          but help you to focus your ideas.
