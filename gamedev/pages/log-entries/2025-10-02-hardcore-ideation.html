          Earlier this week I sat down and finally decided to write out this one
          idea that's been stuck in my head. The idea incorporates concepts I
          learned about distributed systems from my recent research into my
          game, which was something I wanted to do from the start. On top of
          that, I've really been interested in a number of things including a
          game called <i>Routine</i>, making-of videos about <i>Alien</i>,
          and—as I said before—fault tolerant distributed systems. One thing
          I've been trying to work on during the process of designing this game
          is being more intentional about where I'm getting and using
          inspiration. One thing I learned from reading
          <i>Game Design Workshop</i> by Tracy Fullerton is that although there
          are many things in games and media I find "cool", that doesn't mean
          they all make meaningful or sensible additions to my game, and often
          times these can actually cause game designers to get off track. Now,
          my process of vomiting this idea into writing feels like a deviation
          from that effort, but I'm glad I decided to do it anyway. I really
          just started writing down every idea I could think of in a
          stream-of-consciousness style. After a solid 1-2 hours of this I
          decided I had enough to start editing through. I thought that the
          structure of a concept document might force me to answer some
          questions I didn't realize I had. Then, talking about it in my meeting
          with Dr. Eldin, it feels like we've reached a tipping point, the
          catalyst being the fleshing out of the ideas I had. Now, I'm feeling
          like all I want to do is work on this project...
