          I did it! I just finished pitching my game at the DNID Capstone Pitch
          event and it went great! Had this been a year ago and had I not been
          so passionate about this project, I probably would have just passed
          the opportunity up, but I decided to push myself to try to improve and
          learn. I'm glad I did. A major concern for me was firstly getting my
          game across concisely, but also presenting in a natural way and not
          reading from slides. I prepared by being very familiar with the info
          on the slides, which was rather easy, writing speaker notes, and then
          practicing it by performing it for my roommates. These are all
          commonplace in public speaking learning, but I had never actually done
          this. My first iteration of speaker notes I tried to write as similar
          to how I would naturally say the info on the slides. I quickly found
          that this just led me to reading from them, which I wanted to avoid. I
          revised them by distilling them as much as possible.

          Now, the main tangible outcome from this was feedback from both fellow
          students, but also professors and two industry professionals who
          attended. The main feedback I got included my project being
          potentially useful in the actual distributed systems industry to train
          workers on the systems, as well as my project having a massive scope
          and something that a fully fledged team would take years to make. The
          first thing I hadn't considered, and while it's not really the
          direction I want to go, it was interesting to hear and sparked some
          further ideas. My considerations of balancing mechanics taking a long
          time were affirmed, not that I was doubting that. However, generally
          people really found it interesting, and I got lots of people coming up
          to say that my idea was interesting! Another bit of feedback I got was
          that using Godot to make my game would mean that my project would
          matter little to potential jobs that I'm interested in. While I do
          recognize this is a possibility, I feel that the two aren't really
          different enough for the transfer of skill gained in Godot to Unity to
          not be considered by future employers. Also, I love open source
          software, so... fuck it.
