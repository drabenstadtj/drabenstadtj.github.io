          This week I worked on the AI system for LGS. The robots are humanoid
          security units meant to be off-the-shelf hardware LGS modified for
          facility use. A focus is balancing the system so that the AI feels
          threatening and reactive without being unfair — something I'd been
          thinking about since reading breakdowns of the AI design in
          <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, which handles this problem better than
          almost any other game I can think of. I spent a while thinking through
          the architecture before writing any code.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is split into two layers. The first is an
          <strong>AI Director</strong> — a global autoload that manages pacing
          and tracks robot state across the whole facility. It holds save data
          for every robot so their positions and states persist when you leave
          and re-enter areas. Robot data is serialized as Godot Resource files
          and written to disk on scene transition, keyed by level and robot ID.
          When a robot spawns it checks for saved data and restores from it,
          otherwise starts fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second layer is the <strong>per-robot behavior</strong>, built
          from a reusable state machine (shared with the player controller) and
          a sensory component. Each robot has four states: Patrol, Investigate,
          Hunt, and the groundwork for more later. In Patrol the robot samples
          random walkable points from the navmesh and wanders between them. The
          sensory component runs every frame checking for the player — vision
          uses a horizontal and vertical FOV cone check followed by a physics
          raycast for line of sight. Detection builds a confidence value over
          time rather than triggering instantly, so brief glimpses don't
          immediately alert the robot. Once confidence hits a threshold the
          robot transitions to Hunt and actively chases. If it loses sight, a
          countdown timer runs and it falls back to Investigate, searching the
          last known position before giving up and returning to Patrol.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also added a hearing system. Player actions like walking, running,
          and jumping emit sound events through the Director, which broadcasts
          to all nearby robots. Each robot's sensory component checks the sound
          against a distance-based threshold curve — loud sounds carry further,
          quiet ones don't. This means crouching and moving carefully actually
          matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two-layer design is directly inspired by the AI system in Alien:
          Isolation, where a high-level Director manages the Xenomorph's pacing
          and a separate behavior layer handles its real-time reactions. The
          Director in that game is responsible for making the alien feel
          omnipresent and fair — nudging it toward the player when tension is
          low, pulling it back when things get too intense. I wanted the same
          feel for LGS. The Director and the per-robot behavior are deliberately
          decoupled — the Director handles pacing and persistence, the robots
          handle their own moment-to-moment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, the Director side is still incomplete. Right now robots
          find the player entirely through their own sensors. The Director isn't
          yet sending hints to robots about the player's general location, which
          is a key part of what makes the Isolation system work — it's what
          stops the alien from wandering the wrong end of the map while you
          stand still for five minutes. Implementing that is the next priority
          on the AI side.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other obvious gap is that the robots have no body. No model or
          animations so they're just a capsule moving around the level.
          Animation is something I find genuinely difficult and have been
          putting off. Rigging and animating a humanoid robot is a non-trivial
          chunk of work and I don't want to block AI progress on it, so for now
          the logic runs on a placeholder. It'll need to be tackled eventually
          but I'd rather have the behavior working correctly first.
