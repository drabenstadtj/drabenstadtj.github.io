          It's been a while since updating this log as I've gotten caught up in
          too many things since last semester. Alas, I wrapped up last semester
          with a week of flu-fueled frantic work where my entire household
          (myself included) came down with the flu. I ended up finishing what I
          set out to do over the course of the semester, which was to complete a
          concept doc, a game design doc, a macro, and a prototype. These can be
          accessed <a href="/lamport.html">here</a>. By the end of the semester
          I felt like I came to experience things I was warned about in feedback
          I received throughout the semester — things such as the project being
          quite large in scope and the subject matter making for a potentially
          niche audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over winter break I did some light polish, and this semester I picked
          things back up under a new independent study, this time focused on
          implementation rather than design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bulk of the work since then has been level building and
          environment. I've been learning Blender and Photoshop to solidify an
          asset creation workflow for low-poly style assets, and I set up the
          project with TrenchBroom for quick level design. A demo level with a
          tutorial system was added to give new players a guided introduction to
          the mechanics, which has surfaced what I think will be the defining
          challenge of this project: communicating the concepts within the game.
          BFT is complex, and it's hard to convey how it works without shoving a
          wall of text down the player's throat. This is something I'll have to
          carefully work through and iterate on for the entire lifetime of this
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also come to realize this project is going to take a long time.
          Around my second week of heavy implementation I had a bit of a crisis,
          sparked by not seeing much visible progress after putting in a lot of
          work. I felt like the concept was too complicated and bloated — and
          honestly I still do, a little. It's something I'll keep in mind as I
          keep building. A piece of advice you hear constantly from developers is
          to distill your concept down to the smallest possible thing, and this
          project is pretty much the opposite of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of that said, I'm learning a lot. Even if this game takes forever
          to reach a finished state, the process itself has been worth it.
