          It's been a little while since an update, mostly because I've been
          heads-down working on Lamport General Systems. <br />
          For a few weeks after finishing my concept doc, I've been designing
          the BFT system for the in-game network. I hadn't realized that even
          though it doesn't have the same constraints as a real BFT system, it's
          still really hard. I'm trying to make it fun, base it on real-life BFT
          systems, and keep it accessible—which turns out to be actual system
          design work. The tough part is making decisions when you have to
          consider how each one affects everything else in the system. I keep
          feeling like I haven't thought through all the implications, which is
          uncomfortable. <br />
          But apart from the design challenges, it's been great to finally start
          building things in Godot. I began with some Python scripts to model
          the system, then realized GDScript was just as simple to use, so I
          switched over. After iterating on the Godot design for a bit, I've
          ended up with a few different underlying system designs, a harness
          that ties the systems into the 3D game world, and I even made some
          models in Blender. Now I have some neat low-poly server computers,
          monitors, and a working BFT system—though it still needs balancing.
