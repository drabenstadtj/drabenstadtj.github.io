      <h1>Caterpillar Quest</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Team:</strong> Jack Drabenstadt, Matthew Kindja<br />
        <strong>Role:</strong> Game Designer, Hardware Engineer
      </p>

      <p>
        Caterpillar Quest is a casual exploration game inspired by
        <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em>. Players control a caterpillar that
        eats its way through a colorful world, grows through stages of life, and
        eventually transforms into a butterfly. The game combines exploration,
        light puzzles, and a visible progression system where size directly
        reflects player growth. We developed a minimum viable product over two
        months, then built a custom Arduino glove controller to pair with it.

      <h3>Game Design</h3>

      <p>
        The player moves the caterpillar toward the cursor with left click and
        jumps with right click. Eating food increases the caterpillar's size,
        unlocking access to larger foods and new areas. As the caterpillar
        grows, so does its obstacles. Three levels progress from morning to
        evening to night, each with unique lighting and environmental
        challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        NPC interactions with a slug (early game) and a cat (late game) provide
        optional dialogue and perspective on the caterpillar's metamorphosis.
        Food choices offer strategic tradeoffs: blueberries grant a single jump,
        strawberries provide a speed boost — each opens new areas. Growing too
        large, however, can lock you out of smaller spaces you previously
        explored.
      </p>

      <h3>Custom Hardware Controller</h3>

          src="../static/images/controller_glove_final.jpeg"
          alt="Arduino glove controller"
          class="img-strip"

      <p>
        I built a custom Arduino controller to pair with the game. An MPU6050
        accelerometer tracks hand tilt, mapping directly to cursor position —
        level hand centers the cursor, tilting moves it proportionally. Penny
        buttons sewn into the glove fingers complete circuits when touched to a
        thumb ground, emulating left and right mouse clicks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The initial approach was velocity-based: the Arduino calculated movement
        vectors and PyAutoGUI moved the mouse relative to its current position.
        This produced choppy, drifting movement and never felt intuitive.
        Switching the Python library to pynput fixed the choppiness but not the
        underlying problem — accelerometers measure force, not position, so
        velocity control was fundamentally mismatched.
      </p>

      <p>
        We pivoted to joystick-style absolute positioning. The cursor position
        is now mapped directly to the sensor's tilt angle relative to a
        calibrated neutral position. Hold level, cursor stays centered. Tilt
        left, cursor moves left. This was immediately more intuitive and paired
        naturally with the game. The Python pipeline handles auto-detection,
        calibration, deadzone filtering, scaling, and cursor control via pynput.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hardware evolved alongside the software. We originally intended
        3D-printed finger buttons with tactile switches, but impatient
        supergluing rendered both prototypes non-functional. We pivoted to
        pennies: drilled, soldered, and sewn directly into the glove fingers.
        Touching a finger penny to the thumb penny completes the circuit. It's
        not elegant, but it worked reliably for the entire playtest session.
      </p>

      <h3>Playtesting & Iteration</h3>

      <p>
        A blind playtest with five users revealed key issues: food was difficult
        to spot against the environment, dialogue boxes obstructed the view, and
        players wanted camera zoom controls. We responded by increasing food
        contrast, adding a progress bar, implementing scroll-wheel zoom, and
        locking player movement during dialogue. Players consistently cited
        movement and jumping as the most enjoyable elements.
