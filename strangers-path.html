    <h1><a href="index.html">Home</a> > Stranger's Path</h1>
    <p>
      This project was developed over the course of my
      <em>Immersive Media Technologies</em> class. Across three deliverables—an
      introductory cutscene, a tutorial, and a polished release—I created a
      short 3D game in Unity. The game follows a stranger arriving in an
      unfamiliar town, unsure whether they are searching for something or
      running away from their past.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <div style="overflow: auto">
      <img
        src="static/images/strangers-chest.png"
        style="float: left; height: 175px; padding-right: 20px"
      />
      <p style="margin-top: 0">
        Players experience the story from a first-person perspective. A tutorial
        sequence teaches the basics of movement using <strong>WASD</strong> keys
        and interaction with <strong>E</strong>. Early in the experience,
        players must sprint through the environment to catch a hat carried by
        the wind, reinforcing the sense of being disoriented in a new place.
        These small interactions help build immersion and connect the player to
        the character’s journey.

    <h2>Development Process</h2>

    <p>
      Over the semester I learned and applied several Unity tools and workflows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Using <strong>Unity Timeline</strong> to create and synchronize an
        introductory cutscene.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building environments with Unity’s
        <strong>terrain and foliage painting tools</strong> for grass, trees,
        and ground textures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designing <strong>interactable objects</strong> that respond to player
        input and collisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrating physics elements such as triggers, rigidbodies, and
        raycasting to support tutorial mechanics.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    <p>
      The final release was submitted to Itch.io as a polished prototype. It
      combined a narrative introduction, a guided tutorial, and interactive
      activities within a cohesive environment. This project taught me a lot
      about technical Unity skills.
