        I began building my home server a few years ago after watching YouTube
        videos on self-hosting. At the time, my networking experience was limited
        to port-forwarding for a Minecraft server, but as a PC enthusiast with
        spare computer parts, I decided to assemble a server of my own to
        experiment and learn.

    <div style="overflow: auto; margin-bottom: 20px">
      <img
        src="static/images/wintermute-built.JPG"
        alt="Built server"
        style="float: left; width: 300px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
      />
      <p>
        Setting up my first applications required extensive research and hands-on
        problem solving. I spent entire evenings reading technical documentation
        and forum posts, learning to configure firewalls, manage DNS, implement
        reverse proxies, and troubleshoot networking and application issues. The
        process, although time-consuming, was immensely rewarding and sparked a
        deep passion for systems administration and self-hosting.

      As my collection of applications grew, managing them directly on the host
      system became increasingly complex and error-prone. I researched
      containerization and taught myself Docker, migrating all applications into
      containers. This improved system organization, simplified updates, and
      allowed me to scale more efficiently. I also prioritized security from the
      start, carefully evaluating which ports to expose and forwarding only what
      was necessary, while implementing protective measures such as reverse
      proxies and fail2ban to safeguard the server from attacks.

      <img
        src="static/images/power.png"
        alt="Power meter"
        style="float: right; width: 250px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
      />
      <p>
        Over time, my server began serving more than just my own needs. Friends
        and family started relying on it for media access, which added a layer of
        responsibility and motivated me to ensure uptime and reliability. I
        upgraded my storage from a few terabytes to nearly 50TB and implemented
        RAID for redundancy. Additionally, I replaced a power-hungry graphics card
        with a more efficient integrated GPU, cutting electricity usage nearly in
        half while future-proofing storage capacity.

      Since these upgrades, my focus has shifted to expanding capabilities,
      experimenting with popular applications, and maintaining the serverâ€™s
      stability and security. This project has been an ongoing, hands-on
      education in networking, system administration, security, and
      containerization. Through this project, I have developed hands-on
      experience in managing complex systems, strengthened my technical skills,
      and cultivated a proactive approach to independent learning, which I
      continue to use today.
