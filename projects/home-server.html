      <h1>Home Server</h1>

      <p>
        I started building my home server a few years ago after going down a
        rabbit hole of YouTube videos on self-hosting. At the time, I had
        limited networking experience but was a longtime PC enthusiast with
        spare parts sitting around. The idea of running my own services instead
        of relying on cloud providers was too appealing to pass up, so I
        repurposed an old build and started experimenting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Setting up the first few applications required extensive research into
        areas I had little prior exposure to. I had to learn how firewalls
        actually work, how DNS resolution chains together, and how reverse
        proxies sit in front of services to handle routing and SSL termination.
        Every new application I wanted to run came with its own set of
        troubleshooting challenges, from port conflicts to permission issues,
        and each one taught me something new about how Linux systems and
        networking actually operate under the hood.

        alt="Building the server"
        class="img-strip"
      />
      <p>
        As the number of applications grew, managing everything with bare-metal
        installations became unsustainable. I taught myself Docker and migrated
        my services into containers, which made deployment, updates, and
        isolation dramatically easier. Security became a priority early on. I
        set up reverse proxies to avoid exposing services directly, configured
        fail2ban to block brute-force attempts, and developed a habit of
        auditing access logs and hardening configurations as part of routine
        maintenance.
      </p>

        class="img-strip"
      />
      <p>
        Over time, friends and family started relying on the server for media
        streaming and file sharing. That growing dependence pushed me to take
        reliability and storage seriously. I upgraded to nearly 50TB of storage
        with RAID redundancy to protect against drive failures. I also replaced
        the power-hungry dedicated GPU with a CPU that has capable integrated
        graphics, which cut the server's electricity consumption nearly in half
        while still handling hardware transcoding for media streaming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, my focus has shifted from just getting things running to
        expanding capabilities, experimenting with new tools, and maintaining
        long-term stability and security. The home server has become an ongoing
        education in networking, system administration, security hardening, and
        containerization. Every problem I solve on it deepens my understanding
        of the infrastructure that underpins modern computing, and I continue to
        treat it as both a practical tool and a hands-on learning environment.
