      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <p>
        A few years ago I went down a rabbit hole of YouTube videos on
        self-hosting and never really came back up. The idea of replacing
        subscription services with software I actually control was too appealing
        to ignore, so I repurposed an old PC build with spare parts and started
        experimenting. I knew hardware well but networking was mostly new
        territory.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Evolved</h3>
      <p>
        Getting the first few services running required learning things I'd
        never had a reason to touch before — how firewalls actually work, how
        DNS resolution chains together, how a reverse proxy sits in front of
        your services to handle routing and SSL termination. With every new
        application came its own troubleshooting rabbit hole: port conflicts,
        permission errors, misconfigured environment variables. Each one taught
        me something real about how Linux systems and networks operate under the
        hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the number of services grew, bare-metal installs became unmanageable.
        I taught myself Docker and migrated everything into containers, which
        made deployment, updates, and isolation dramatically cleaner. Around
        that time security became a serious priority — I configured NGINX Proxy
        Manager so nothing is exposed directly, set up fail2ban against
        brute-force attempts, and developed habits around reviewing access logs
        and locking down service configurations beyond their defaults.
      </p>
      <p>
        When friends and family started relying on the server, reliability
        became far more important. I upgraded to nearly 50TB of storage with
        RAID redundancy, and replaced a power-hungry dedicated GPU with a CPU
        with capable integrated graphics, cutting electricity consumption nearly
        in half while still handling hardware transcoding.
      </p>

          — roughly half the consumption.

      <h3>Current State</h3>

          src="../static/images/wintermute_dashboard.png"
          alt="Home server dashboard"
          class="img-strip"

        <strong>Media &amp; personal tools.</strong> Jellyfin handles media
        streaming for friends and family. Immich manages 19,000+ personal
        photos. Navidrome handles music streaming, Kavita and Calibre cover
        ebooks and comics. Vaultwarden runs my personal password manager,
        Miniflux handles RSS, and Home Assistant ties in home automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Observability.</strong> Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter
        provide real-time system monitoring and dashboards. Uptime Kuma tracks
        service availability — currently 100% uptime across all monitored
        endpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Infrastructure.</strong> NGINX Proxy Manager routes and secures
        all external-facing services behind a single reverse proxy. Dockge
        provides a clean UI for managing the container stack.
      </p>

      <h3>Ongoing</h3>
      <p>
        The focus has shifted from getting things running to long-term
        stability, security hardening, and expanding capabilities. Current
        interests include improving the monitoring stack, tightening backup
        strategy, and continuing to experiment with new self-hosted tools as
        they mature. The concepts worked through here — containerization,
        reverse proxies, network security, system monitoring — map directly to
        the infrastructure layer of production software.
