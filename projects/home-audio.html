      <h1>Whole Home Audio</h1>

      <p>
        I have always been obsessive about audio quality. Over the years I
        accumulated a collection of speakers across different rooms, but they
        all operated independently. What I really wanted was seamless whole-home
        sound, where music could follow me from room to room in perfect sync.
        The inspiration came from two places: the legendary Paradise Garage in
        New York, where the entire space was designed around the sound system,
        and Nowadays, a club in NYC that treats audio as an integral part of the
        clubgoing experience.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>

      <p>
        The system is built on Snapcast, an open-source multi-room audio
        solution with a server-client architecture. The snapserver runs inside a
        Docker container on my home server, acting as the central audio source.
        Each room has a Raspberry Pi running a snapclient, which receives the
        audio stream over Wi-Fi and plays it through the connected speakers. To
        get clean analog output from the Pis, I soldered dedicated DAC boards
        onto each one, bypassing the Pi's built-in audio which is notoriously
        noisy.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        I designed and 3D-printed custom cases to house each Raspberry Pi and
        its DAC cleanly. It took several iterations to get the fit, ventilation,
        and cable routing right, but the final versions are compact and tidy
        enough to sit next to speakers without being an eyesore. Snapcast
        handles all the synchronization between clients, compensating for
        network jitter to keep every room playing in lockstep. For music input,
        I use Librespot, which presents the system as a Spotify Connect device,
        so anyone on the network can cast music to the whole house directly from
        their phone. I am also experimenting with AirPlay support to allow
        seamless switching between sources.
      </p>

      <h3>The Inspiration</h3>

      <p>
        Paradise Garage was a space designed almost entirely around the
        experience of listening. Larry Levan and Richard Long built the system
        so that the music was not just heard but felt, with every corner of the
        room receiving the same quality of sound. That philosophy, of designing
        a space around its sound rather than bolting speakers on as an
        afterthought, is what I wanted to bring into my own home on a smaller
        scale.
      </p>

          src="../static/images/paradise-garage.png"

          class="img-strip"
        />
        <figcaption>

          part of the space, not an afterthought

      <p>
        Building this system also ended up being a natural extension of my
        distributed systems experience. Managing synchronized audio streams over
        Wi-Fi, dealing with clock drift between independent clients, handling
        network interruptions gracefully, and coordinating a central server with
        multiple edge devices are all problems that are conceptually similar to
        working with Linux sockets and building small-scale distributed systems.
        The overlap between the audio project and my academic work was
        unexpected but made the technical challenges feel familiar and
        approachable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system is now fully functional, with synchronized playback running
        reliably across multiple rooms. I am always looking for projects that
        sit at the intersection of hardware, software, and design, and this one
        hits all three. Whether it is iterating on the 3D-printed enclosures,
        experimenting with new audio sources, or optimizing the network
        configuration for lower latency, there is always something to refine and
        improve.
