      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <p>
        I have always been obsessive about audio quality. Over the years I
        accumulated speakers across different rooms, but they all operated
        independently. What I really wanted was seamless whole-home sound —
        music that could follow me from room to room in perfect sync. Two places
        crystallized the idea: the Paradise Garage in New York, where the entire
        space was designed around the sound system, and Nowadays, a club in NYC
        that treats audio as an integral part of the experience.
      </p>

      <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        The Paradise Garage was a space designed almost entirely around the
        experience of listening. Larry Levan and Richard Long built the system
        so that the music was felt as much as heard, with every corner of the
        room receiving the same quality of sound. That philosophy — designing a
        space around its audio rather than treating it as an afterthought — is
        what I wanted to bring into my own home on a smaller scale.
      </p>

          class="img-strip"
        />
      </figure>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        The system is built on Snapcast, an open-source multi-room audio
        solution with a server-client architecture. The snapserver runs in a
        Docker container on my home server, acting as the central audio source.
        Each room has a Raspberry Pi running a snapclient, which receives the
        audio stream over Wi-Fi and plays it through the connected speakers.
        Snapcast handles synchronization between all clients, compensating for
        network jitter to keep every room in lockstep.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get clean analog output from the Pis, I soldered dedicated DAC boards
        onto each one, bypassing the Pi's built-in audio which is notoriously
        noisy. I designed and 3D-printed custom enclosures to house each Pi and
        DAC — it took several iterations to get the fit, ventilation, and cable
        routing right, but the final versions are compact enough to sit next to
        speakers without being an eyesore.
      </p>
      <p>
        For music input, Librespot presents the whole system as a Spotify
        Connect device, so anyone on the network can cast to the whole house
        directly from their phone. I'm also experimenting with AirPlay support
        for seamless source switching.
      </p>

      <h3>The Distributed Systems Connection</h3>
      <p>
        Building this turned out to be a natural extension of concepts I'd
        worked with elsewhere. Managing synchronized audio streams over Wi-Fi,
        dealing with clock drift between independent clients, handling network
        interruptions, and coordinating a central server with multiple edge
        devices all map closely onto distributed systems problems. The overlap
        made the technical challenges feel familiar and the solutions more
        principled.
      </p>

      <h3>What's Next</h3>
      <p>
        The system runs reliably across multiple rooms with consistent
        synchronized playback. Current focus is adding AirPlay as a second input
        source and refining the enclosure design. Longer term I want to add
        per-room volume control through a unified interface rather than managing
        each client independently.
