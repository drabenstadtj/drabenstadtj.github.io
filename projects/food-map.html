        Built for and currently being deployed in partnership with the
        Pittsburgh Policy Initiative — helping Pittsburgh residents find food
        assistance across nearly 800 locations citywide. No account required:
        search, filter by type or distance, check what's open right now, and
        get directions. PPI staff manage the full dataset through a role-gated
        admin dashboard.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Food insecurity is a persistent challenge in Pittsburgh, with many
        neighborhoods lacking consistent access to affordable, healthy food. A
        2019 map by Code for Good Pittsburgh helped visualize food deserts and
        resources, but it fell out of maintenance. The Pittsburgh Policy
        Initiative set out to revitalize and expand it — building a sustainable
        platform that supports both residents finding help today and policymakers
        understanding the landscape long-term. PPI also needed staff tools to
        maintain the data without a developer in the loop, and a way to accept
        community tips without opening the database to the public.
      </p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>
        Lead developer on a small team — full-stack architecture, deployment
        infrastructure, and core feature implementation.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Built</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Filtering by type, distance, and hours.</strong> Users can
        narrow results by resource type (food pantry, food bank, community
        fridge, and more), filter by distance from their location, and toggle to
        show only currently open sites. Hours are stored as structured JSON per
        day and checked client-side against the current time — the same data
        structure also powers an admin hours editor for staff. Together these
        filters address the most common frustration with resource finders:
        wading through irrelevant or closed locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Community suggestion pipeline.</strong> Anyone can submit a new
        resource location for review. Admins can approve, reject, geocode via
        Nominatim, and promote a suggestion into a live map entry in a single
        workflow — keeping the dataset accurate without requiring staff to do all
        the legwork. The suggestion retains a link to the created resource for a
        clean audit trail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Containerized deployment.</strong> The full stack ships as two
        Docker containers (Flask/Gunicorn + Nginx) behind an external reverse
        proxy. The database is volume-mounted so data persists across rebuilds
        with zero downtime — important when PPI staff depend on it daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security model.</strong> Admin registration requires an existing
        admin session, so there's no open self-registration endpoint exposed to
        the public. Production uses HTTPS-only session cookies with secrets
        injected via environment variables.
      </p>
