        A capstone project built for and currently deployed with the Pittsburgh
        Policy Initiative — helping residents find food assistance across nearly
        800 locations citywide. No account needed. Search, filter by type or
        distance, check what's open right now, and get directions. PPI staff
        manage the full dataset through a role-gated admin dashboard.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Food insecurity is a persistent challenge in Pittsburgh, with many
        neighborhoods lacking consistent access to affordable, healthy food. In
        2019, Code for Good Pittsburgh built a map to visualize food deserts and
        resources, but it fell out of maintenance. The Pittsburgh Policy
        Initiative set out to rebuild it — not just as a resident-facing tool,
        but as a platform staff could maintain without a developer and where
        community members could contribute updates directly.
      </p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>
        Lead developer on a small team. Owned the full-stack architecture,
        deployment infrastructure, and most of the feature work.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Built</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Filtering by type, distance, and hours.</strong> Users can
        narrow results by resource type (food pantry, food bank, community
        fridge, and more), filter by distance from their location, and toggle to
        show only currently open sites. Hours are stored as structured JSON per
        day and checked client-side against the current time. That same data
        structure powers an admin-facing hours editor — one schema serving both
        the public UI and the management tool. These filters address the most
        common frustration with resource finders: wading through irrelevant or
        closed locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Community suggestion pipeline.</strong> Anyone can submit a new
        resource location for review. Admins can approve, reject, geocode via
        Nominatim, and promote a suggestion into a live map entry in a single
        workflow. The suggestion retains a link to the created resource for a
        clean audit trail. This keeps the dataset accurate without requiring
        staff to source every update themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Containerized deployment with a closed security model.</strong>
        The full stack ships as two Docker containers (Flask/Gunicorn + Nginx)
        behind an external reverse proxy, with the database volume-mounted so
        data persists across rebuilds. Admin registration requires an existing
        admin session — there's no open self-registration endpoint. Production
        uses HTTPS-only session cookies with secrets injected via environment
        variables. PPI staff depend on this daily, so the deployment had to be
        simple to maintain and hard to break.
