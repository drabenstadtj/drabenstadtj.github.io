    <h1><a href="../index.html">Home</a> > Dynamic System Reconfiguration</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I worked closely with Dr. Amy Babay on the design and implementation of a
      fully dynamic reconfiguration system for a multi-site distributed network
      system called
      <a href="https://github.com/amybabay/spire/tree/dev-reconf">Spire</a>. The
      system allows runtime updates to topology, cryptographic keys, and
      component roles without downtime, enabling robust response to failures and
      temporary deployments like mobile control centers.
    </p>

    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Config Manager:</strong> Converts a high-level YAML
        configuration into a complete, signed configuration, generating all
        necessary cryptographic keys.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Config Disseminator:</strong> Reliably transmits the signed
        configuration to all participating hosts, handling large configurations
        via fragmentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Config Agent:</strong> Runs on each host, receives and verifies
        the configuration, applies updates to local components, and triggers
        reloads or restarts to activate changes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Replaced hard-coded system constants with a human-readable YAML
        configuration model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed a hybrid cryptography system (AES-256 + RSA-OAEP) with digital
        signatures to secure sensitive keys and configuration integrity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refactored core applications to dynamically load network addresses,
        keys, and threshold cryptography shares at runtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented reliable multicast delivery with message fragmentation and
        version tracking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Validated the system in a 26-node Docker environment with multiple
        failure and recovery scenarios.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Technical Challenges and Resolutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Legacy Static Configuration Dependencies</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Challenge:</em> Components relied on compile-time constants and
            hardcoded arrays, making runtime reconfiguration impossible without
            risking inconsistencies or crashes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Resolution:</em> Performed a full audit of static constants,
            replaced them with dynamic initialization functions, and refactored
            core subsystems to read values from the unified YAML file at
            startup.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cryptographic Key Management</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Challenge:</em> Integrating a secure key distribution and
            storage mechanism into a system with multiple key types while
            ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Resolution:</em> Implemented a hybrid encryption scheme
            combining AES-256 for bulk data and RSA-OAEP for key protection.
            Automated key generation and YAML population ensured secure and
            reproducible configuration artifacts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reliable Network Dissemination of Large Configurations</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Challenge:</em> Configuration payloads could exceed a single
            network message size, requiring reliable delivery to many hosts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Resolution:</em> Designed a message fragmentation and reassembly
            protocol over Spines multicast. Agents verified completeness and
            signatures before applying configurations, preventing partial
            updates or replay attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Host Identification and Environment Ambiguity</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Challenge:</em> Determining which host an agent was running on
            was error-prone when relying solely on IP address parsing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Resolution:</em> Config_agent now accepts the host's unique
            hostname as a command-line argument, providing a deterministic and
            unambiguous host identification mechanism.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Integration Bugs from Extensive Refactoring</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Challenge:</em> Refactoring core components to remove static
            dependencies introduced subtle bugs, including segmentation faults
            and mismatched key sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Resolution:</em> Built a comprehensive containerized test
            harness to simulate all sites. Incremental validation, detailed
            logging, and automated cryptography verification allowed systematic
            bug identification and resolution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
