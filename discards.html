      <p>
        <strong>Discards</strong> is a first-person narrative game built in the
        Godot engine. The game explores themes of identity, digital
        consciousness, and moral responsibility. The player enters a strange,
        liminal city and becomes involved in a system where their consciousness
        can be cloned into a body called a “discard.” At a key moment, the
        player must choose whether to endure a painful experience or create a
        clone to endure it in their place. The outcome is deliberately
        ambiguous—although the player chooses to clone, they still experience
        the event firsthand, leaving it unclear whether they truly avoided the
        suffering or became the clone themselves. This uncertainty is central to
        the game’s emotional and philosophical impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was made for my <em>Narrative and Technology</em> class.
        Over the semester we learned ideas from Janet Murray, Henry Jenkins, and
        Espen Aarseth, and <strong>Discards</strong> is my way of trying to use
        those ideas in a game. The goal was to take the theories we studied and
        show how they can shape story, space, and player choice.

      <h2>Design Principles</h2>
      <img

        style="float: right; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px"
      />

      <p>
        This project uses Janet Murray’s properties of digital media from
        <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> (Murray 71-90): procedural,
        participatory, spatial, and encyclopedic. <strong>Discards</strong> is
        procedural because it uses programmed rules to simulate consequences and
        reinforce narrative themes. For example, when the player first wakes up
        in the clinical cell—after having been unknowingly cloned—the game
        introduces visual and auditory distortions that represent a break in the
        character’s continuity of self.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is participatory because the player must later make a
        meaningful choice that affects the narrative outcome. The decision
        whether to suffer or delegate pain to a clone establishes the player’s
        role within the system and builds emotional weight through interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is spatial, meaning the story unfolds through the player's
        movement and exploration of the environment. The environment conveys the
        central narrative twist—that the player has been cloned—through layout,
        timing, and visual discovery. Elements like lighting, architecture,
        ambient sound, and empty space contribute to a mood of unease and
        detachment.
      </p>
      <h2>Narrative and Storytelling</h2>
      <img
        src="static/images/discards-bar.png"
        style="float: left; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px"
      />
      <p style="margin-top: 0">
        From Henry Jenkins’
        <em>Game Design as Narrative Architecture</em> (Jenkins 7-12), the game
        draws on embedded and evocative storytelling. Clues about the world are
        placed in the environment—medical tools, computers, signage—so the
        player pieces together meaning through exploration. The game does not
        rely on cutscenes or exposition. Its tone and structure are influenced
        by lo-fi horror games like <em>Mouthwashing</em> and
        <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, which use minimal visuals and ambient design to
        convey narrative through space.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project also uses ideas from Espen Aarseth’s
        <em>Cybertext</em> (1997), especially ergodic structure and aporia.
        Aarseth defines ergodic literature as requiring nontrivial user effort
        (Aarseth 1–2). In <strong>Discards</strong>, the effort comes from
        deciding who suffers. The player has only one chance to create a clone.
        Once the decision is made, the outcome is locked in, reflecting aporia:
        the loss of paths not taken, creating emotional weight and consequence.
      </p>

      <h2>Influences</h2>

      <p>
        The game is influenced by <em>SOMA</em> (Frictional Games, 2015), which
        explores consciousness transfers and identity through gameplay.
        <strong>Discards</strong> brings that concept forward, letting the
        player choose whether to create a version that will suffer. The
        consequences are then lived directly, adding urgency and moral pressure
        to the experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Discards</strong> uses a simple structure to explore complex
        ideas. By applying theories from Murray, Jenkins, and Aarseth, the game
        creates a focused, interactive experience where a single choice defines
        identity, consequence, and memory.
