      <h1>When Rules Write the Story: Exploring Once Upon a Time</h1>

      <p>
        Once Upon a Time is a card game in which a group of players collaborate
        to create a story while using up all of their cards. The object of the
        game is to create a fairy tale-esque story by the end. The game's system
        allows players to create entire stories from very little starting
        material, something that would be hard for many to do otherwise. Its
        fairy tale theming encourages players to draw on familiar genre
        traditions to create something recognizable. This is reminiscent of
        Henry Jenkins' concept of evocative spaces, where experiences such as
        stories become more compelling by building upon traditions well known to
        participants (Jenkins 6). Yet this same system sometimes works against
        us: players prioritize winning over constructing cohesive narrative,
        producing a disjointed, circuitous story that is difficult to recall.
      </p>

      <p>
        To better understand how Once Upon a Time draws on familiar traditions
        and genres, it helps to look more closely at Jenkins' idea of evocative
        spaces. Jenkins defines 'evocative spaces' as spaces that draw from and
        build upon existing stories or genre traditions that are familiar to
        participants (Jenkins 6). These spaces do not need to tell their own
        stories but rely on the audience's prior knowledge to fill in the gaps.
        Often referencing known genres, intellectual property, or archetypal
        story elements, evocative spaces allow creators, or in this case
        storytellers, to craft environments that feel meaningful without
        extensive exposition. In the context of Once Upon a Time, the concept of
        evocative narrative elements helps explain how players can quickly
        generate coherent narratives by drawing upon shared cultural knowledge
        of fairy tale conventions.
      </p>

      <p>
        While evocative spaces explain how players can build from existing
        knowledge, the rules of Once Upon a Time actively shape the story on a
        finer scale. During my group's run of the game, our story began
        cohesively as a tale of a giant who sought to build a better life for
        himself despite his lack of education and illiteracy. After encountering
        a witch and being cursed, he gained the ability to speak and attend
        school. However, as players tried to play their story cards and
        interrupt one another in an attempt to win the game, the story quickly
        spun out of control. Random elements were introduced, and the narrative
        became disjointed and chaotic. With more experienced and confident
        players, this issue can be mitigated, as players can call out
        nonsensical narrative turns and use their cards strategically. Despite
        these occasional disruptions, the mechanics ultimately do more to
        support storytelling than to hinder it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond narrative and mechanics, the social dynamics of our group
        significantly shaped the experience. Confidence and experience played a
        noticeable role: at times, the game suffered because players
        misunderstood the rules, yet no one felt confident enough to correct
        them. Several players used interrupt cards incorrectly, treating them as
        excuses to halt the story and drop in unrelated elements, which
        disrupted the flow. I was struck by how different this felt compared to
        the video of Wil Wheaton's group playing the game, where everyone knew
        the rules and confidently created smooth, believable narrative beats.
        Our own gameplay might have flowed more easily had we been more familiar
        with each other, and more comfortable calling one another out when
        someone added a story card too abruptly or stalled while thinking of
        what to say next. This shows that the social side of play—the confidence
        of participants, their shared understanding of rules, and their
        willingness to negotiate—was just as important as the formal rules in
        shaping the story.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mechanics of Once Upon a Time provide a form of narrative
        scaffolding: the story cards offer players specific narrative points to
        build toward, while the ending cards provide a clear way to conclude the
        story and a goal to work toward, helping players construct coherent
        narratives more easily than if they were creating a tale entirely from
        scratch. The game's cards and mechanics align with aspects of Abbott's
        definition of narrative. Story and interrupt cards represent the story
        aspect, providing events, entities, and setting for players to
        incorporate into their narratives (Abbott 19). In contrast, the
        narrative discourse is reflected in the game's rules: players must
        orally convey the narrative to the group, shaping the story in real time
        and negotiating the narrativity as they go (Abbott 24). Furthermore,
        story cards often prompted constituent events that drove the narrative
        forward, such as the Giant being cursed by the witch or attending school
        (Abbott 22). Many elements introduced to play their cards functioned as
        supplementary events: tangential or filler moments that did little to
        advance the story (Abbott 22). While these elements added some
        unpredictability, they contributed to the narrative becoming circuitous
        and difficult to recall. In this way, the mechanics simultaneously
        provide material for storytelling and structure the process by which
        that story is communicated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once Upon a Time demonstrates the delicate balance between storytelling,
        game systems, and social interaction. The mechanics provide powerful
        scaffolding that makes the creation of fairy tale-like narratives
        accessible, even for players who might otherwise struggle to invent
        stories from scratch. At the same time, the drive to play cards and
        pursue victory often fractured the story, producing supplementary events
        that diluted narrative cohesion. Jenkins' concept of evocative spaces
        helps explain why the stories still felt recognizable and meaningful,
        while Abbott's distinction between story and discourse clarifies how the
        mechanics structured our storytelling in real time. Yet what mattered
        just as much as rules and theory was the social side of play:
        confidence, negotiation, and familiarity with the group shaped whether
        our story flowed or fell apart. Once Upon a Time reminds us that
        storytelling in games is always co-created by systems, narrative
        conventions, and the players around the table.
